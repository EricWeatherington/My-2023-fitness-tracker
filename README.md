# My-2023-fitness-tracker

Hello!  This is my final project for Web Development 2 with Code Louisville.  As I have been intereted in improving my health and fitness this year, I was excited to implement the concepts and skills learned from Code Louisville to build this fitness tracker.

This app is simple to use, with a lot of engagement features.  The workout tracker and goals list will save your inputs to Local Storage so that you can make sure to stay on top of your own fitness goals.

From the list of required features to include, I chose the following: 

1.  Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.  
      - You will be able to see this feature being implemented in my "random cheat meal generator"

2.  Calculate and display databased on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
      - I decided to make a countdown for the new year!  A reminder that time goes quickly, and I need to make efficient use of my time.
 
3.  Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
      - Using an API key from Open Weather Map, you will be able to see the daily forecast for any city you desire.

4.  Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)
      - I used a table for my workout tracker that will save your inputs to Local Storage.  



Thanks for stopping by!
