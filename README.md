# My-2023-fitness-tracker

Hello!  This is my final project for Web Development 2 with Code Louisville.  As I have been intereted in improving my health and fitness this year, I was excited to implement the concepts and skills learned from Code Louisville to build this fitness tracker.

You can access this website by following the link attached below:

This app is simple to use, with features that will require the user's input (further descriptions below).  The "workout log" and "goals list" sections will save your entries to Local Storage so that you can make sure to stay on top of your own fitness goals.


Apps that the user can interact with: 

- In the weather forecast section, please enter the city name that you would like to view.  After clicking on the search icon(right side), you should see the app open up a more detailed view of the cities current forecast.

- The workout tracker section contains a "add new entry" button on the right hand side.  Click this button when you would like to add your new excercise entry.  You can select the date by clicking on the calender icon, select the drop down arrow to choose from a selection of exersices, and can also type in the time (minutes) in the duration section.

- For the fitness/personal goals section, all you need to do is type in a new goal and click on the add button on the right hand side.  These entries will be saved to local storage.  Once you have completed or no longer need the goal, you can click on the open circle icon to show that the task has been completed, or click on the X button to delete the goal from the list.

-  For the cheat meal generator, after clicking on the button you should find a random cuisine option take the place of the "your answer awaits" block.

From the list of project features to include, I chose the following to implement into my project: 

- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.  
      - You will be able to see this feature being implemented in my "random cheat meal generator"

- Calculate and display databased on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
      - I decided to make a countdown for the new year!  A reminder that time goes quickly, and I need to make efficient use of my time.
 
- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
      - Using an API key from Open Weather Map, you will be able to see the daily forecast for any city you desire.

- Visualize data in a user friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc)
      - I used a table for my workout tracker that will save your inputs to Local Storage.  

Thanks for stopping by!
